# Polyominos tilings

Home repository for the project on _polyominos tilings_ for the course
on computational geometry (INFO-F420).

## Running

The project was built using the programming language Julia inside a Pluto notebook. To open the notebook interactively, either install Julia and run the following lines inside a REPL:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto")
using Pluto; Pluto.run()
```

Or use Binder by opening the resulting website of the project, clicking in the upper right corner and choosing the first option.
